Headcount Test Harness
======================

For testing [headcount](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount).

Project description is [here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

## Project Structure

For this harness to work, all the `require` statements in your
Headcount project must be `require_relative`.

For example a file at `headcount/lib/district_repository.rb` that needed
to require the adjacent `district` file, it would require it like so:

```
require_relative "district"
```

This is one of the few times we will ask you to use `require_relative`, but
it will make things much easier in this case since we are using this
external test harness to verify the functionality of your code.

## Installing Locally

Git clone this project into a directory that lives at the same level
as your `headcount` project directory. It should be arranged like:

    <my_code_directory>
    |
    |\
    | \headcount/
    |
    |\
    | \headcount_test_harness/
    |

## Usage

Change directories into the `headcount_test_harness/` directory and then execute:

    $ bundle

To load in dependencies for the spec harness.

To test your implementation against the evaluation specs, run:

    $ bundle exec rake

## Usage -- Running Specific Iterations

If you want to run specific iterations, use the following format:

	$ bundle exec rake test <iteration name> <iteration name>

Where `<iteration name>` is `one`, `two`, `three`, etc.

For example:

	$ bundle exec rake test zero one two

would run tests for only those iterations.

## Note on the Spec Data

The "answers" for the various tests in this test harness is being compiled from
previous student projects. It is very possible that there will be mistakes along the
way, and we would love to get your help in finding and correcting these

To help this, we'll adopt the following process:

If you encounter a mistake in the spec harness data, open a pull request to this
repository fixing the mistake. If 5 students comment with a `+1` on the pull request
indicating that they also got the same answer, we will accept the change.
